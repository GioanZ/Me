# 💫 About Me:
Hi everyone!!! 👋<br>I'm a Computer Engineer, with a passion for finance 😎.<br>Right now I am very busy in my new job, as a backend developer 👨‍💻. As I have joined a team working on a huge new project 🌐!<br>For privacy reasons  🔇🤫, I cannot include pieces of code 👾 that come from work, even if written entirely by me.<br><br>In my spare time I mainly study 🧐 artificial intelligence 💻 and finance 🏛️,  and then work with both 👯 in the future.<br><br>Here you will find what I learned during college 👨‍🎓 and extra courses, some small functional codes 👾 that have served me and might come in handy for someone else 🤝, and what I plan to do later when I have a lot to give ⌛🔜.
